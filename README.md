# liri-node-app

In this assignment, we were **held at gunpoint** and told to construct what is called LIRI (*or else!*). LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  Specifically for Spotify, Bands in Town & OMDb.

From the terminal, you can enter *"node liri.js"* followed by 1 of the following:
    *"spotify-this-song"* followed by a song name
    *"concert-this"* followed by a band/artist name
    *"movie-this"* followed by a movie title

Each time you do this, the app will return results based on you search.  For example:

    Entered on the command line:    *"node liri.js spotify-this-song hotel california"*

    Results returned:               *"Artist: Eagles"*
                                    *"Song: Hotel California - 2013 Remaster"*
                                    *"Album: Hotel California (Remastered)"*
                                    *"Preview mp3: https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/50e82c99c20ffa4223e82250605bbd8500cb3928?cid=fc664f741c8d438487daa6efa6df8070"*
